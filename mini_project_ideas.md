## Mini Projects

### Directions

Skilling up in web scraping requires practice, and conducting a small project is a great way to learn more about any facet of data- or computer science.  Choose one of the following questions to explore further or create your own “mini project” by checking out [this list of lists of lists on Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lists_of_lists).  

You should begin by scraping the links from the list page, then follow each link and scrape any relevant information you’d like, prepare the data, and store it for later use.  Once you have collected your data, use any tool you already know about to complete your analysis (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, Excel, Tableau, etc.).  Do not worry about fully completing this mini project today; you can continue working on it at home to further hone your skills.

### Project Ideas

1.	**_TEA_**.  Starting from this list of [tea-drinking countries]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tea_consumption_per_capita), what factors (if any) about a country correlate with its annual tea consumption per capita?
2.	**_NOVELS_**.  Based on [Time’s List of the 100 Best Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%27s_List_of_the_100_Best_Novels), do extraordinary novels have anything in common?  What about the authors of these books?
3.	**_90s COMEDIES_**.  Comedy films during the 1990s were interesting to say the least.  From _Home Alone_ at the start of the decade to _10 Things I Hate about You_ at the close.  What data trends can you find about these [comedies from the 1990s]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_comedy_films_of_the_1990s)? (Note: there were quite a few comedies produced in this decade.  For a shorter project, just pick your favorite year to explore.)
4.	**_VOLCANOES_**.  Large volcanic eruptions are often devastating but luckily rather rare.  Using these lists of eruptions from the [20th]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_of_the_20th_century) and [21st]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_in_the_21st_century) Centuries, can you collect the longitude and latitude for each eruption and then build a visualization displaying the locations of these recent volcanic disasters?
5.	**_STATE CAPITOLS_**.  How much to you know about the state capitols of the United States?  Starting from this [list of state capitols]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_and_territorial_capitols_in_the_United_States), gather information for each city by visiting its Wikipedia page.  Can you find any interesting patterns?  For example, do Eastern states tend to pick larger cities for their capitols as compared to the West?  Do Southern capitols enclose more area or water than Northern ones?
6.	**_ENGLISH SCULPTURES_**.  Did you know England is home to more than 180 notable outdoor sculptures?  Build a map from the geographic coordinates of each statue by visiting each link in [this list]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Outdoor_sculptures_in_London).  What region of England is home to the most statues?
7.	**_ONLINE FOOD_**.  Find out what you can about [these online food ordering services]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_about_food_and_drink#Online_food_ordering).  Which service employs the most people?  Which one brings in the most revenue?  In which country/year was each service founded? 
8.	**_TEEN MAGAZINES_**. Wikipedia [lists several magazine options for teens]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_teen_magazines), but unfortunately, many are no longer producing issues.  Can you come up with a reliable way to determine which magazines are out-of-business by scraping information from these links?
